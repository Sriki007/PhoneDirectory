# Getting Started

I have built the project in Spring Tool Suite 4

It is a web service project, where we are giving the search string in the URL.

I have assumed the data is available in the data base as below:
{"srikanth", "sandesh", "rajesh", "rakesh", "chandru", "chethan", "akash", "adesh", "kiran", "karthik"};

Further I have done the code to search based on the inputs given in the URL

To run this project only this we need to have STS tool and on just running the project the server gets started.

URL : http://localhost:8080/home?search=YOUR STRING

example URL's:

1. http://localhost:8080/home?search=s
2. http://localhost:8080/home?search=sr
3. http://localhost:8080/home?search=ra
4. http://localhost:8080/home?search=rj
5. http://localhost:8080/home?search=c
6. http://localhost:8080/home?search=ch
